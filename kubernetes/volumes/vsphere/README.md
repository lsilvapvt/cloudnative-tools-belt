## Persistent Volumes in vSphere

Notes and sample files created while managing persistent volumes in vSphere. 

See official documentation on [vSphere Storage for Kubernetes](https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/index.html) for more information.

See sample files in this repository to define a default `storage class` for LUN volumes and to create `Persistent Storage Claims` that can be bound to storage and then consumed by a `pod`
