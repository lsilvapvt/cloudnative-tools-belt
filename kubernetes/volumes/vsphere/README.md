## Persistent Volumes in vSphere

Notes and sample files created while managing persistent volumes in vSphere. 

See official documentation on [vSphere Storage for Kubernetes](https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/index.html) for more information.

See sample files in this repository for defining a default `storage class` fo LUN volumes and how to create `Persistent Storage Claims` that can be bound to storage and consumed by a `pod`
